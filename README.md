# GangsterRP-OldProject
This is a Fivem Server that i made with my friends. (ESX Legacy) (2 years ago)
** To set up the mobile to work you need to download screenshot-basic script
** The files are compressed beacuse i cant upload more than 100 files :(
** There are scripts that i dont own, that are downloaded from the oficial cfx forums or github but there are 100% functional and with all erros fixed
** This repository works for me to save my old projects
** The server is probably obsolete now but you can grab the script that you want and see what i did
** Streams file are not in because it is 25 gb
** Probably i miss a lot of files because github is so slow
Feel free to use
If you want to use please set up the server cfg and download the basic Fivem Gamemode files (fxserver)
